### My Story 👩🏾‍💻 

In ‘02, I began my career as a self-taught freelance web developer. My enterprise career spanned from 2006 to 15 as a front-end developer. Afterwards, I was a bootstrapped founder for 10 years. I became my mom’s caregiver in 2021, taking a three-year career break to assist her in her golden years.

My recent work focuses on helping people maintain their wealth and wellbeing. This conviction was born out of my own personal experience. It amazed me how much caregiving is a systemic issue for working-class families.

Now, I spend my days filling my gaps in programming, systems, and AI concepts. During nights and weekends, I search for opportunities to help caregivers’ well-being.
